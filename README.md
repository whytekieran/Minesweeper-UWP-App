## **_Introduction_**
This is a Minesweeper game built for the Universal Windows Platform. The game consists of three difficulty settings, easy, medium and hard. The higher the difficulty, 
the more mines the player has to try and avoid. In any of these difficulty settings the player can choose from a 6x6 grid game, 8x8 grid game of a 10x10 grid game. <br><br>
To play the game you firstly choose the size of grid you want to play on. This will generate the grid for you. The player can then start to click/tap on the individual cells
of the grid. When clicked the cell can turn one of three colours. A green cell means that all the surrounding cells of the one clicked are safe and no mine is in them. A yellow 
grid means that there is a mine in one of the cells that surrounds that cell that was clicked. A red cell means that you have hit a mine, at this point all the other mines will
be shown (Blow up) and the game is over. When the player manages to only have cells with mines left in the grid he/she will be notified they have won. <br><br>
When the player wins a game he/she will then have the option to save their score to high scores. These are stored in an SQLite database and the table they are saved into depends
on which type of game and difficulty settings the user has choosen. The game itself does have a rules page which decribes how to play the game to any user that downloads it.
//could possibly add link to the store once its on it.
